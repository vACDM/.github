# VATSIM Airport Collaborative Decision Making

Welcome to vACDM, an implementation of Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) procedures on VATSIM.
vACDM offers a plugin for EuroScope and uses a centralized server to handle the A-CDM process and synchronize data between clients.

### Features

- Centralized Server: Ensuring data synchronisation between EuroScope clients and external tools.
- ECFMP Integration: vACDM applies ECFMP measures such as MDIs.
  Adherance to other measures will be expanded with Version 2.
- Scenery Integration: vACDM times can be displayed to VATSIM pilots using [Nool VDGS](https://vdgs.nool.ee).
  Other scenery developers have also expressed their interest and are preparing to implement vACDM into their VDGS.
